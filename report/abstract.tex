    Visual learning presents an opportunity to more effectively teach computer science fundamentals. However, existing solutions are unable to both facilitate user interaction and focus on implementation. This paper describes an assignment and programming framework for teaching graph traversal algorithms. Visualization tools are contextualized as a way to improve the learning experience, and an evaluation of the project with real students is discussed.
