    The use of geospatial data has become increasingly prevalent in digital communication. However, the core functionality of existing platforms remains largely independent of our physical surroundings. This paper presents a proof of concept for a novel communication app that uses geospatial data to control access to the sending and receiving of messages. The implications of this technology are explored, and an evaluation of the project with real users is discussed.
