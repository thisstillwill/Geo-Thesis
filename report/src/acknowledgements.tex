\section*{Acknowledgements}

The submission of this paper coincides with the end of my senior year, and with it the end of my Princeton career. I am ever grateful to the Computer Science Department for enabling me to pursue a very unique project, one that truly combined my interests in technology, society, and communication. I thank my advisor, Professor Michael Freedman, for challenging me to answer the hard questions and to pursue a project with a purpose. I also thank Dean Anne Caswell-Klein and the rest of the First College staff. Their support not only brought me to the finish line but also left me proud to have reached it. Finally, I thank my family and friends. Through thick and thin, you have always been there for me.
